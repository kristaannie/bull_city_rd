Women of all experience levels are welcome to learn with us and get their skate on.</p><div class=button-section><button class=practice>Practice</button> <button class=learn-more>Learn More</button> <button class=follow-us>Follow Us</button></div></div><div class=outer-modal><div class=inner-modal><div class=x-button>x</div><div class=practice-content><h1 class=headline-text>Schedule</h1><h2>Address</h2><p>911 Ramseur Street Durham NC 27701</p><h2>Practice times</h2><p>Monday -- 6-8pm</p><p>Thursday -- 6-8pm</p><p>Sunday -- 6-8pm (one hour off skate practice)</p></div><div class=learn-more-content><h1 class=headline-text>FAQs</h1><h2>How do I get in touch with you all?</h2><p>Shoot us an email at bullcityrollerderby@gmail.com or join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/828934163853486/">facebook group</a>.</p><h2>What if I don't know how to skate?</h2><p>That's okay! A lot of our current skaters only started skating this year. We are extremely welcoming to new skaters of all skill levels.</p><h2>Do I need equipment to join?</h2><p>Buying skate gear can be a daunting and expensive venture, so it is completely understandable if you do not want to immediately launch into it. We have an hour of off skates practice every sunday for those who don't have gear.This is also an awesome opportunity to rub shoulders with league skaters and ask questions about gear. We also have several loaner pairs of skates and pads.</p><h2>What equipment should I get?</h2><p>If you are skating on the track, you must also be wearing knee pads, wrist guards, elbow pads, a mouth guard and a helmet. There are several locations in the area that sell this gear. <a href="http://www.derbycityskates.com/">Derby City Skates</a> in Winston-Salem is a great resource and owned by a fellow skater. They also do online ordering. <a href="http://www.playitagainsportscary.com/">Play it Again Sports</a> in Cary has a lot of affordable gear and if you mention our name you will be given a discount. You can also order you gear from <a href="http://www.bruisedboutique.com/onlinestore/">Bruised Boutique</a> which has great package deals.</p><h2>How else can I help?</h2><p>A roller derby league is so much more than just its skaters, so any form of help is welcome. We need Refs, None Skating Officials and just general volunteering with fundraising and out reach. Any little bit helps.</p></div></div></div></div></section><script src=//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.min.js></script><link rel=stylesheet href=jquery-ui.min.css><script src=external/jquery/jquery.js></script><script src=jquery-ui.min.js></script><script src=js/vendor.js></script><script src=js/app.js></script></body></html>
