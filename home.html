Women of all experience levels are welcome to come learn with us, and get your skate on.</p></div></div></section><section><div id=learn class=panel><h1>FAQ's</h1><h2>What if I don't know how to skate?</h2><p>That's alright! No one knows how to skate when they first start. A lot of our current skaters only started skating just this year. We are extremely welcoming to new skaters of all skill levels.</p><h2>Do I need equipment?</h2><p>Buying skate gear can be a daunting and expensive venture, so it is completely understandable if you do not want to immediately launch into it. We have an hour of off skates practice every sunday for those who don't have gear. This is also an awesome opportunity to rub shoulders with league skaters and ask questions about gear. We also have several loaner pairs of skates and pads.</p></div></section><section><div id=header><ul id=navigation><li><a id=link-practice href=#practice>Practice</a></li><li><a id=link-learn-more href=#learn>Learn More</a></li><li><a id=link-news href=#news>News</a></li></ul></div></section><script src=js/vendor.js></script><script src=js/app.js></script></body></html>
